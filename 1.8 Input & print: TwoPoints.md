# Distance between two points
## Write a program to calculate the distance between two points.
# 1 Do it your own way
## Solve it the way using whatever technique works for you. 
# 2.Do it incrementally  (remember Maze 10 in Blockly?)
## 3.Look at the first test case - Point p1 = (0,0) and Point p2 =(4,0). If you mentally apply your mind, the answer is 4. Write the simple formula for this and past the test case.
## 4.Look at the second test case - Point p1 = (4,0) and Point p2 = (0,0). The answer should again be 4. But what does your code calculate the value to? What is the one simple change you will do to make it pass Test case 1 and Test case 2?
## 5.Now consider two points on the Y-axis, say (0, 2) and (0, 4). What additional line of code will you write to tackle this?
## And then comes the complex one: What if the points are (0, 0) and (4, 3)? 
## First calculate in your own head, what should be the distance? What changes to the logic will you make it to match 5? 
Eventually, remove all the unnecessary "doodling" / comments and present the code properly.

```

```
x1 = int(input())
y1 = int(input())
# get the y coordinate of Point 2
x2 = int(input())
y2 = int(input())
# get the x coordinate of Point 2
# get the y coordinate of Point 2
Distance = int ((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
result =(Distance**.5)
print(result)
