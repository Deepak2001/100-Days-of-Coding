# Distance between two points
# Write a program to calculate the distance between two points.
## 1 Do it your own way
 
## 2.Do it incrementally  (remember Maze 10 in Blockly?)

Eventually, remove all the unnecessary "doodling" / comments and present the code properly. 

```
Example 

INPUT 
4
0
0
0

OUTPUT
4


INPUT 
0
0
4
3

OUTPUT
5


```

```
x1 = int(input())
y1 = int(input())
# get the y coordinate of Point 2
x2 = int(input())
y2 = int(input())
# get the x coordinate of Point 2
# get the y coordinate of Point 2
Distance = int ((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
result =(Distance**.5)
print(result)

```
